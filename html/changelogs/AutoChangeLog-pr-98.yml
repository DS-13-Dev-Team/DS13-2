changes:
  - rscadd: The Pulse Rifle is now able to toggle between a grenade launcher in addition
      to regular fire
  - tweak: Using the pulse rifle while holding it will now wield it which causes it
      to behave the same as before. Firing it with only one hand will cause it to
      have higher spread.
